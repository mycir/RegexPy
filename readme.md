# RegexPy

Yet another playground for testing <ins>Python</ins> flavoured regular expressions.

![Screenshot](./screenshots/regexpy.gif)

Hover over matches/groups to identify their indexes (TODO keyboard navigation).

Edit the sample [config](./regexpy.conf) file to suit, e.g. highlighting colours.

Last saved regex, last loaded/saved sample and flags are reloaded on restart.

Tab/Shift+Tab move focus - to enter a tab character use Ctrl+Tab.

## Dependencies

Python >= 3.7, PySide6, Qt >= 6.4
